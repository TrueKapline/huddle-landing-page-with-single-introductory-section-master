## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GitHub Pages
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

I have added icons in this project using Font Awesome. This is my first time ever using this sort of tool.

### Continued development

Next I want to focus on JavaScript learning. Make projects with only HTML and CSS was fun, but I need to go further.

### Useful resources
